This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a local URI that isn't properly formatted or accessible.  The most common causes are incorrect file paths or issues with the assets management in your Expo project.

Example of incorrect usage:
```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'assets/myImage.jpg' }} />
```

This might fail if the `assets` folder isn't correctly configured within your project. Expo needs to know where to locate these assets.

Another potential issue is if you're trying to access an image from a dynamic source without proper error handling. This could be because the URL is invalid or unavailable.
